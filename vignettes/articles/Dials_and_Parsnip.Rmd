[`parsnip`](https://tidymodels.github.io/parsnip) is a package in development that provides more unified interfaces to model functions. It has functions to create a _model specification_ that can be used to fit a particular model using different R packages (or by other means). these model specifications have main arguments for important tuning parameters.  For example, a minimal model specification is:

```{r bst-spec}
library(parsnip)
boost_tree(mode = "regression")
```

This particular model has a number of different arguments for tuning parameters:

```{r bst-str}
str(boost_tree)
```

If we know exactly what specific value of a parameter should be, it can be specified:

```{r bst-args}
boost_tree(mode = "regression", trees = 50, min_n = 5, sample_size = 3/4)
```

Note that :

 * These parameter names have identically named parameter objects in `dials`.
 * Like other `parsnip` functions, `boost_tree` can use different R packages to fit this model, in this case, `xgboost` and `C50`. Not all parameters to `boost_tree` are relevant to each of these specific models. 
 * Any parameters not specified in this call will use their model-specific defaults. 

What happens if you know that you want to optimize the value of a parameter but don't know what the value will be? In this case, the `parsnip` function `varying()` can be used as a placeholder. For example, `min_n` is conditional on the sample size of the training set, so we may not know a feasible value until be have the exact training or analysis set: 

```{r bst-vary}
mod_obj <-
  boost_tree(
    mode = "regression",
    trees = varying(),
    min_n = varying(),
    sample_size = varying()
  )
mod_obj
```

If some type of grid search is used, there is a simple function in `dials` can be used to update this parameter specification with candidate values. Let's create a small, random grid for these parameters as if we were going to model the `mtcars` data set. We will set the ranges for these parameters in-line when creating the grid:

```{r bst-grid}
library(tidymodels)
library(dials)

mtcars_pred <- mtcars %>% select(-mpg)

set.seed(1263)
bst_grid <- grid_random(
  trees,      # Has complete default ranges      
  min_n       %>% finalize(mtcars_pred), 
  sample_size %>% finalize(mtcars_pred), 
  size = 10
)
bst_grid
```

We can use the `merge` function to combine these parameters with the model specification:

```{r bst-merge, eval = FALSE}
bst_grid <- 
  bst_grid %>%
  mutate(specs = merge(mod_obj, .))

bst_grid[1, ]
bst_grid %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  pull(specs)
```
